# OWASP Halifax

OWASP (https://www.owasp.org) is a United States Sec 501(c)(3) not-for-profit charitable
organisation focused on improving the security of software.

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Halifax is an OWASP Canadian Chapter
governed under the rules for Chapter Leaders provided by OWASP.

## Chapter Leadership

Tyler Parrott (tyler.parrott@owasp.org)

## Purpose
OWASP Chapters exist to raise awareness of the OWASP mission, making application security
visible, at the local level. The OWASP Foundation encourages anyone with an interest in
furthering the OWASP mission at the local level to either get involved in their local
OWASP chapter, or if one doesn’t exist, start a new OWASP chapter. Local chapter outreach
is one of the most significant ways that individuals learn about the organization and
become connected to the OWASP community. Therefore, enabling local chapter leaders and
volunteers to not only hold meetings, but also contribute to projects, organize training
and events, and find new ways to evangelize about application security in their city or
region becomes a key to the success and growth of the much larger global organization.

## Oversight
The OWASP Halifax Chapter is overseen on an operational basis by the OWASP Foundation Staff
and, ultimately, the Global OWASP Board. Overall activities must comply with bylaws, policies
and handbooks, and code of ethics.

If the Foundation Staff or Global OWASP Board determines that an OWASP Chapter Leader has not
complied with these rules, their status as an OWASP Chapter Leader may be revoked. Additionally,
OWASP administrative access (including the leader’s owasp.org email address) may be immediately revoked.

## Mandatory Rules

The OWASP Halifax Chapter adheres to the OWASP Mandatory Rules:
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Chapter_Handbook/Chapter_2:_Mandatory_Chapter_Rules).

## Core Values

*OPEN* Everything at OWASP is radically transparent from our finances to our code.
*INNOVATION* OWASP encourages and supports innovation and experiments for solutions to software security challenges.
*GLOBAL* Anyone around the world is encouraged to participate in the OWASP community.
*INTEGRITY* OWASP is an honest and truthful, vendor neutral, global community.

## Collaborators

The [OWASP/owasp-halifax](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-halifax) GitHub
repository is maintained by the Chapter Leadership and additional Collaborators who
are added by the Chapter Leadership on an ongoing basis.

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made
Collaborators and given commit-access to the project.

These individuals are identified by the Chapter Leaders and their addition as
Collaborators is discussed as a pull request to this project's
[README.md](./README.md#people).

_Note:_ If you make a significant contribution and are not considered
for commit-access log an issue or contact a Chapter Leader directly.

## Modifications
Modifications of the contents of the
[OWASP/owasp-halifax](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-halifax) repository
are made on a collaborative basis.  Anybody with a GitHub account may
propose a modification via pull request and it will be considered by
the Collaborators.  All pull requests must be reviewed and
accepted by a Collaborator with sufficient expertise who is able to
take full responsibility for the change.  In the case of pull requests
proposed by an existing Collaborator, an additional Collaborator is
required for sign-off.  Consensus should be sought if additional
Collaborators participate and there is disagreement around a
particular modification.  See _Consensus Seeking Process_ below for
further detail on the consensus model used for governance.

Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial
modifications, or modifications that have not found consensus for
discussion by assigning the ***meeting-agenda*** label to a pull
request or issue.

The Chapter Leadership will serve as the final
arbiter where required.

For the current list of Collaborators, see the project
[README.md](./README.md#people).

## Meetings

The Chapter meets occassionally to discuss Chapter business and to further
the aims of OWASP by hosting speakers and discussions.  All minutes
are recorded in the
[OWASP/owasp-halifax](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-halifax) repository
and published to the OWASP Halifax website (https://owasp.github.io/owasp-halifax)

## Consensus Seeking Process

The Chapter follows a [Consensus
Seeking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making)
decision-making model.

All proposed changes to the Chapter must be made in the form of a pull
request to the repository (directly committing to a production branch
of the repository is not permitted).  The consensus seeking process
will then follow via discussion by the members and Collaborators on that pull
request.

Changes deemed trivial by Collaborators may be merged instantly, without
waiting for consensus, so long as they leave a note explaining the reason
for the merge.

When an item has appeared to reach a consensus any Collaborator
may ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the
consensus.

If an item cannot reach a consensus a Chapter Leader may unilaterally
decide.

## Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

* (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
  have the right to submit it under the open source license
  indicated in the file; or

* (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
  of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
  license and I have the right under that license to submit that
  work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
  by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
  permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
  in the file; or

* (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
  person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
  it.

* (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
  are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
  personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
  maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
  this project or the open source license(s) involved.

## Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct is adapted from [Rust's wonderful
CoC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/wiki/Note-development-policy#conduct).

* We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
  environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
  disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic.

* Please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that
  might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
  all.

* Please be kind and courteous.  There's no need to be mean or rude.
* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every
  design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous
  costs.  There is seldom a right answer.

* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum.  If you have solid
  ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.

* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass
  anyone.  That is not welcome behaviour.  We interpret the term
  "harassment" as including the definition in the [Citizen Code of
  Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/); if you have any lack of
  clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read
  their definition.  In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that
  excludes people in socially marginalized groups.

* Private harassment is also unacceptable.  No matter who you are, if
  you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable
  by a community member, please contact one of the channel ops or any
  of the TC members immediately with a capture (log, photo, email) of
  the harassment if possible.  Whether you're a regular contributor or
  a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you
  and we've got your back.

* Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other
  attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.

* Avoid the use of personal pronouns in code comments or
  documentation.  There is no need to address persons when explaining
  code (e.g. "When the developer")
