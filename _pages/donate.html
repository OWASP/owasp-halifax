<h2>Donating to OWASP Halifax</h2>

<p style="text-indent:25px;">Organizations or individuals that are not yet interested in becoming a full Corporate Member but who have a desire to direct their support in a more regional manner may prefer to become a local chapter supporter for OWASP Halifax.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When going through the donation process you need to select <strong>Chapter Supporter</strong> then when asked about which chapter you wish to support you must specify <strong>OWASP Halifax</strong> if you wish to support the OWASP Halifax Chapter.</p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p style="text-indent:25px;">Be recognized as a supporter by posting your company logo on the OWASP Halifax website (Image size for logos: gif, jpg or png with a size of 150px X 45px at 72dpi or 55px X 80px at 72dpi).</p>

<ul>
  <li>$500 - Silver Supporter</li>
  <li>$1000 - Gold Supporter</li>
  <li>$2000 - Platinum Supporter</li>
</ul>

<p>Any donation amount is alright as anything helps with our operational costs.</p>
