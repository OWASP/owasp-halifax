# About Us

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Halifax Chapter (https://owasp.github.io/owasp-halifax)
is a Chapter of the OWASP worldwide charitable organization (https://www.owasp.org) focused on improving
the security of software.

Our mission is to make software security visible, so that individuals and organizations are able to make
informed decisions.

OWASP Halifax is in a unique position to provide impartial, practical information about Application Security
to individuals, corporations, universities, government agencies and other organizations worldwide.

Operating as a community of like-minded professionals, OWASP Halifax issues software tools and
knowledge-based documentation on application security.

Everyone is free to participate (we are wheelchair accessible) in OWASP Halifax and all of our materials are
available under a free and open software license.

You'll find everything about OWASP Halifax here and current information on our OWASP Halifax Blog.

OWASP Halifax does not endorse or recommend commercial products or services, allowing our community to remain
vendor neutral with the collective wisdom of the best minds in software security worldwide.
